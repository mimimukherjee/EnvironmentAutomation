## Introduction

 This lab tutorial shows you how to deploy an Oracle Service Bus application to Oracle SOA Suite Cloud Service.

**_To log issues_**, click here to go to the [github oracle](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/issues/new) repository issue submission form.

## Objectives

- Using this lab, you can deploy your Oracle Service Bus applications to Oracle SOA Suite Cloud Service. Because this cloud service uses the same Oracle SOA Suite software that you use for your on-premises applications, you can use the same tools in the cloud.

## Required Artifacts

- SOACS instance must be up and running before running the lab.
